# Lung_Cancer_Detection
Deep Learning for Medical Imaging in Lung Cancer using CNN Architecture


Problem Statement
Lung cancer is a global health challenge, with early detection and type classification crucial for effective treatment. CT scan images can be analyzed for early detection but may miss subtle patterns. Deep learning models, like EfficientNetB0, Inceptionv3, and VGG16, excel in recognizing intricate patterns and automatically learning relevant features from data. This study uses a dataset of CT scan images of lungs categorized as normal, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. The objective is to train three models, compare their accuracy, and make predictions with the one with the highest accuracy, demonstrating the potential of deep learning in lung cancer detection and type classification.
